## 🌱 Writing Philosophy

I believe good documentation should:
1. **Reduce cognitive load** – by being structured, concise, and easy to scan  
2. **Bridge gaps** – between technical and non-technical stakeholders  
3. **Enable independence** – allowing users to find answers without hand-holding  
4. **Evolve continuously** – documentation is a living product
